`# Caesar Cipher Program

This project is a **Caesar Cipher Program** implemented in Python. It allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique, which shifts each letter in the message by a specified number of positions.

## Overview

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter in a text with another letter a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This program provides:
- **Encryption**: Shifts each letter in the message by a specified number of positions to create an encrypted message.
- **Decryption**: Reverses the shift to return an encrypted message to its original form.

## Features

- Encrypts and decrypts messages with a user-defined shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters.
- Preserves non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation) without modification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher `

1.  Run the program:

    bash

    Copy code

    `python caesar_cipher.py`

### How to Use

1.  Choose whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a message by typing `encrypt` or `decrypt` when prompted.
2.  Enter the **message** to encrypt or decrypt.
3.  Provide a **shift value** (an integer between 0 and 25) to determine the shift for the cipher.

### Sample Interaction

bash

Copy code

`Caesar Cipher Program
Type 'encrypt' to encrypt or 'decrypt' to decrypt a message: encrypt
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter the shift value (0-25): 3
Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog!`

Functions
---------

-   **encrypt(text, shift)**: Encrypts the provided `text` by shifting each letter by `shift` positions. Returns the encrypted string.
-   **decrypt(text, shift)**: Decrypts the provided `text` by reversing the shift. Returns the original string.
-   **main()**: Runs the user interaction, allowing for encryption or decryption based on user input.

Notes
-----

-   A shift value of 1 moves each letter one position forward; e.g., "A" becomes "B".
-   Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
-   The Caesar Cipher is a simple and ancient encryption method and should not be used for secure communications.
